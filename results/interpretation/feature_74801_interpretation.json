Mia could encourage William to check if his local area has such programs and how to participate.\n\n2. **Composting**: For organic waste like food scraps and yard trimmings, composting is an excellent alternative. Mia could provide information on how to set up a compost bin or where to drop off compostable materials.\n\n3. **Local Transfer Stations**: Some areas have transfer stations where residents can bring their waste for proper disposal. Mia could inform William about these facilities and how they operate.\n\n4. **Community Drop-Off Centers**: Many towns have designated drop-off centers for hazardous waste, electronics, and other specific types of waste. Mia could direct William to these locations.\n\n5. **Garbage Collection Services**: Regular garbage collection services are available in most communities.",
