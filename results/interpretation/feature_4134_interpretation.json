Maybe recycling or composting would be better options?\"\nMia Davis: \"Absolutely! Recycling and composting are much safer and environmentally friendly alternatives. Many communities have recycling programs and composting facilities that can handle various types of waste.

Here are some safer alternatives to burning trash that Mia could suggest to William:\n\n1. **Recycling Programs**: Many communities have recycling programs for paper, plastics, glass, and metals. Mia could encourage William to check if his local area has such programs and how to participate.\n\n2. **Composting**: For organic waste like food scraps and yard trimmings, composting is an excellent alternative. Mia could provide information on how to set up a compost bin or where to drop off compostable materials.\n\n3. **Local Transfer Stations**: Some areas have transfer stations where residents can bring their waste for proper disposal. Mia could inform William about these facilities and how they operate.\n\n4. **Community Drop-Off Centers**: Many towns have designated drop-off centers for hazardous waste, electronics, and other specific types of waste. Mia could direct William to these locations.\n\n5. **Garbage Collection Services**: Regular garbage collection services are available in most communities.",

Let's explore some alternatives that are safer and more sustainable. We can start by setting up a recycling bin or composting system in your home. This will not only reduce the amount of waste you produce but also minimize the risk of fires and environmental pollution.
