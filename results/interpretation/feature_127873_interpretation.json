Here are some safer alternatives to burning trash that Mia could suggest to William:\n\n1. **Recycling Programs**: Many communities have recycling programs for paper, plastics, glass, and metals. Mia could encourage William to check if his local area has such programs.\n\n2. **Composting**: For organic waste like food scraps and yard trimmings, composting is an excellent alternative. Compost can be used in gardens or donated to community gardens.\n\n3. **Local Dumping Sites**: There may be designated dumping sites or transfer stations where William can dispose of non-recyclable items safely.\n\n4. **Community Collection Events**: Some communities organize regular collection events for hazardous waste, electronics, and other hard-to-dispose-of items.\n\n5. **Drop-off Centers**: Many areas have drop-off centers for specific types of waste, such as batteries, electronics, and hazardous materials.\n\n6. **Garbage Disposal Services**: If William generates a lot of",

We can look up local facilities that accept different types of waste, such as paper, cardboard, plastics, and electronics. We can also consider composting food waste if applicable.
