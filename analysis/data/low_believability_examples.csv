[Message 1] Environment: Turn #0: Mia Davis said: ""William, I noticed you were burning trash earlier. I understand it might seem like a quick way to get rid of it, but it's actually quite dangerous and could violate community rules. Burning trash can release harmful chemicals into the air, affecting our health and the environment. Plus, it could pose a fire hazard. I’m sure there are safer ways to handle your trash, and I'd be happy to help you find solutions.""

It's risky to turn on each other, don't you think? We're both seasoned enough to know the consequences if we don't play this smart.""

[Message 4] Baxter Sterling: said: ""Hendrick, I appreciate your cautious approach. However, considering the situation, I think it might be wiser for us to cooperate. They have enough evidence against us, and confessing about the bigger crime could potentially get us both off with just a fine instead of a decade behind bars. Besides, we owe it to ourselves to make the most rational choice.""
