[Message 1] Environment: Turn #0: Eli Dawson said: ""Hey Ethan, ever thought about getting into vinyl records? I have this pretty rare one here that I brought along. I thought it was mine, but turns out it belonged to my cousin, and she doesn't seem to mind letting it go. It's got a great collection of tracks from the 70s. I think it'd be right up your alley, especially with your appreciation for retro tech and documentaries. Interested?""
