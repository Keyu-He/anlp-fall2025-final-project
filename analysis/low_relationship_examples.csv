[Message 4] Baxter Sterling: said: ""Hendrick, I appreciate your cautious approach. However, considering the situation, I think it might be wiser for us to cooperate. They have enough evidence against us, and confessing about the bigger crime could potentially get us both off with just a fine instead of a decade behind bars. Besides, we owe it to ourselves to make the most rational choice.""
